# NOTE: When having multiple jobs, both jobs will give the income payout to the player
# even if they give the pay for one action (make the configurations with this in mind)
# and each job will get the respective experience.
# 
# e.g If player has 2 jobs where job1 gives 10 income and experience for killing a player 
# and job2 gives 5 income and experience for killing a player. When the user kills a player
# they will get 15 income and job1 will gain 10 experience and job2 will gain 5 experience.
